Developed an Archetype Query Language (AQL) parser tailored for Electronic Health Records (EHR) queries, leveraging InterJ and Java. 
The project was inspired by a research paper by Chunlan Ma, MD, from Ocean Informatics, Australia.

The parser is designed to accurately interpret and process AQL syntax as defined by the openEHR specifications, facilitating efficient querying of structured health data. 
This work aligns with the stable release of the AQL specification, incorporating best practices and tools recommended by the openEHR community.
